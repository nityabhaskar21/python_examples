Python has five standard data types −
	• Numbers
	• String
	• List
	• Tuple
    • Dictionary

    Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is a ordered collection of data. 
    It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
        List = ["aa", "bb", "cc"] 
        print(List[0])  
        print(List[2]) 

    Just like list, tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. 
    The only difference between tuple and list is that tuples are immutable. 
    Tuples cannot be modified after it is created.
        Tuple = ('aaa', 'bbb') 
        print(Tuple)
        print(tuple[0])

    Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, 
    It is used to store data values like a map. 
    Dictionary holds key:value pair.
        Dict = {1: 'xyz', 'name': 'abc'} 
        print(Dict['name'])
